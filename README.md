Welcome to the Language Learning Flash Cards Application! The current state of the application is in the "folder-editor" branch.

This application serves as a base for future development of a language learning flash cards site that is focused on translating sequences and phrases instead of distinct words. This is a unique approach to language learning that allows for a more natural way of understanding the nuances of a language.

The application is designed using Clean (Onion) architecture, which is a software architecture pattern that separates the concerns of an application into layers that are isolated from each other. This makes it easy to modify and extend the application as needed.

For data access, the application uses EF Core with the Specification pattern. This pattern allows for the creation of reusable query specifications that can be used to build complex queries. EF Core is a lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework that provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.

The application uses Asp Net Core Web Api as the API for communication between the back-end and front-end of the application. This provides a powerful and flexible way to manage data and provides a secure way to handle user authentication.

The front-end of the application is built using Blazor WASM, which is a modern web framework for building interactive web user interfaces using C#. Blazor WASM is a powerful and flexible framework that allows for the creation of rich and interactive web applications.

To get started with the application, simply clone the "folder-editor" branch and follow the instructions in the README file to set up the development environment. Once the development environment is set up, you can start exploring the code and making modifications to fit your specific needs.
